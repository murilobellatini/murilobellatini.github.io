I've always been fascinated with Technology due to its magic to improve people's lives in a continuous & infinite pace. That's why I studied Engineering, got my MBA on Products & Services and I'm now studing Data Science & Artificial Intelligence.

Professionally I've been used to work with on data-oriented problems, going from Prescriptive Modelling on Automotive segment for supercars (believe it or not!) until Social Media & Speech Analytics for Business Insight Generation.

My current data toolkit covers the whole Machine Learning pipeline with Data Collection, Wrangling, Cleaning, Visualization, Predicitive Model Training & Testing — usually in Python. My areas of greatest interest tackle unstructured data problemas such as Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition.

My main goal is to easen the burden of Decision Making in every aspect of our lives through intelligent data-driven models.

<!-- My vision is that through Artificial Intelligence it is possible to free mankind from work by making all resources infinite. That's why my goal is to

I'd say I've been officially involved with Technology since 2008 when I programmed my first Snake Game on C++.


As , I've been involved with technology since 2010 where my passion for programming flourished. At college I've got to know an objective oriented programming language, C++. I couldn't stop learning until finished to hard-code my first Snake Game! With GUI on a DOS-Terminal with timely intervaled screen refreshs for animating movement...
