I've always been fascinated with Technology due to its magic to improve people's lives at a continuous and infinite pace. That's why I graduated in Engineering, got my MBA in Products & Services and now study **Data Science & Artificial Intelligence**.

Professionally, I'm used to face data-oriented problems, going from **Prescriptive Modelling** on Automotive segment for super cars (believe it or not!) until **Social Media & Speech Analytics** for **Business Insight Generation**.

My data toolkit covers the whole **Machine Learning Pipeline** with Data Collection, Wrangling, Cleaning, Visualization, Feature Engineering, **Predictive Modelling & Evaluation**, Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction in **Python**. Currently, the areas of greatest interest to me tackle unstructured data problems such as Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition, especially regarding **Unsupervised Deep Learning**.

My main goal is to ease the burden of Decision Making in every aspect of our lives through **intelligent data-driven systems**.

<!-- My vision is that through Artificial Intelligence it is possible to free mankind from work by making all resources infinite. That's why my goal is to

I'd say I've been officially involved with Technology since 2008 when I programmed my first Snake Game on C++.


As , I've been involved with technology since 2010 where my passion for programming flourished. At college I've got to know an objective oriented programming language, C++. I couldn't stop learning until finished to hard-code my first Snake Game! With GUI on a DOS-Terminal with timely intervaled screen refreshs for animating movement...
